# ConvOuch
In this project we plan to implement the models described in
Development and Validation of Deep Learning Algorithms for Detection of Critical Findings in Head CT Scans
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05854.pdf

Using their publicly availabe CQ 500 dataset. We will start with simple CNN models for hemorrhage classification, and go from there
